# What Test Documentaion?
 Test documentation is documentation of artifacts created before or during the testing of software. It helps the testing team to estimate testing effort needed, test coverage, resource tracking, execution progress, etc. It is a complete suite of documents that allows you to describe and document test planning, test design, test execution, test results that are drawn from the testing activity.For a newbie, it’s easy to assume that Testing is executing the various section of code on an ad-hoc basis and verifying the results. But in the real world, Testing is a very formal activity and is documented in detail. Test Documentation makes planning, review, and execution of testing easy as well as verifiable.

# The degree of test formality depends on
- The type of application under test
- tandards followed by your organization
- The maturity of the development process
# Best practice to Achieve Test Documentation
- QA team needs to be involved in the initial phase of the project so that Test Documentation is created in parallel
- on’t just create and leave the document, but update whenever required
